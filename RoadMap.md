# PowerInterface - RSPS Network Analysis Tool Roadmap

## Project Overview
PowerInterface is a GUI-based network analysis tool specifically designed for RuneScape Private Servers (RSPS). It allows users to monitor, capture, edit, and resend network packets associated with RSPS processes.

## Architecture Components
1. **Process Management Module**
   - Process scanning and enumeration
   - RSPS process identification
   - Process selection interface

2. **Packet Capture Module**
   - Network traffic monitoring
   - RSPS packet filtering
   - Real-time packet display

3. **Packet Manipulation Module**
   - Packet data editing
   - Packet structure validation
   - Modified packet transmission

4. **User Interface**
   - Process selection panel
   - Packet display area
   - Packet editing interface
   - Control options

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Structure & Process Management
- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Implement process scanning using psutil
- [x] Create basic GUI framework
- [x] Develop process selection interface

### Phase 2: Network Packet Capture
- [x] Implement packet capturing using Scapy
- [x] Filter packets related to selected RSPS process
- [x] Display captured packets in GUI
- [x] Add real-time packet monitoring

### Phase 3: Packet Editing & Resending
- [x] Develop packet editing interface
- [x] Implement validation for edited packets
- [x] Create packet resending functionality
- [x] Add packet structure preservation

### Phase 4: UI Enhancements & Security
- [x] Refine user interface
- [x] Add input validation
- [x] Implement permission checks
- [x] Add error handling and logging

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization
- [x] Cross-platform testing
- [x] Performance optimization
- [x] Security testing
- [x] User experience improvements

## Technical Specifications
- **Python Version**: 3.x
- **GUI Framework**: PyQt5
- **Network Library**: Scapy
- **Process Management**: psutil
- **Additional Libraries**: 
  - pandas (for data handling)
  - numpy (for data processing)
  - hexdump (for packet visualization)

## Security Considerations
- Application requires elevated permissions for packet capture
- Implement safeguards against malicious packet injection
- Add warnings for potentially harmful modifications
- Include documentation on ethical usage

## Future Enhancements
- Protocol-specific packet parsers
- Packet sequence automation
- Traffic pattern analysis
- Saved packet templates
- Scripting interface for automated testing
