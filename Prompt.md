You are an expert Python developer with extensive experience in network security, GUI application development, and game server protocols, particularly those related to RuneScape Private Servers (RSPS). Your task is to develop a GUI-based application that enables users to:​
GitHub

Select a Running RSPS Process:

Scan and list all active processes on the system.​

Allow users to select a process, specifically targeting RSPS instances.​
GitHub

Utilize libraries like psutil to retrieve process information.​

Capture and Display Network Packets:

Monitor network traffic associated with the selected RSPS process.​

Display captured packets in a user-friendly format within the GUI.​

Implement packet filtering to focus on relevant RSPS traffic.​

Edit and Resend Packets:

Provide functionality to modify captured packet data.​

Allow users to resend modified packets to the RSPS server.​
GitHub

Ensure proper handling of packet structures and checksums.​

Technical Requirements:

Programming Language: Python 3.x​

GUI Framework: Tkinter or PyQt5 (based on suitability)​

Networking Libraries: Scapy for packet manipulation and sniffing​

Process Management: psutil for process enumeration and management​
GitHub

Platform Compatibility: Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)​

Design Considerations:

User Interface:

Intuitive layout with clear sections for process selection, packet display, and editing.​

Real-time updates of captured packets.​
GitHub

Input validation to prevent malformed packet data.​
GitHub

Security and Permissions:

Ensure the application requests necessary permissions to capture and send packets.​


Implement safeguards to prevent misuse of the tool.​

Extensibility:

Design the application with modularity in mind to allow future enhancements, such as protocol-specific parsers or automated testing scripts.​

Objective:

Develop a robust and user-friendly application that empowers security engineers to interact with RSPS processes, monitor and manipulate network packets, and identify potential vulnerabilities. This tool should serve as a valuable asset in securing RSPS environments against common exploits and ensuring the integrity of server-client communications.
